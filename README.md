## Project 3: Group Chat
### Leah Barnes and Liz Mealing
A group chat project that uses Tkinter for the GUI display of the text area and python for the rest of the code. This includes setting up a server connection and setting up the client GUI. 

#### Features implemented:
- When a person connects to the chat, a message is desplayed that says, "{username} has entered the chat."
- When a person disconnects from the chat, a message is desplayed that says, {username} has left the chat."
- When the server disconnects before any clients do, a message is sent to all clients that the server has disconneted and they are exciting. Then it closes the GUI for them.
- Automatic scrolling when the text box fills up.
- Any amount of people can join.
- People joining and leaving does not affect anyone in the chat already.
